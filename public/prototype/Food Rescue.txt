Food Rescue:

6 Pages
1 - Main page:
	Short intro, ask for zipcode, then CTA to start survey
2 - Survey Page 1
3 - etc


Survey
- Start with zipcode (right away. Also not necessarily part of the survey)
- Describe food (what is it?) Free text w/ auto complete maybe?
- Series of pages, 2 options per, branch from there (include relevant examples on pages)
- Each page of survey is a binary choice

Questions:
- Type of food (processed, canned, cooked)
- Has it been opened?
- Temperature (danger zones?)
- How old is it?
- How yucky is the food? (moldly? is it human consumable?)

End result:
1 - Animals/Compost
2 - Recommend Nearby Food shelf

if human-consumable, show local food shelves first, then show compost/farms/etc

If not human-consumable, show recommendations for future food drops

Any purely informational pages?

- No red/green colors (especially on survey page)
- Think of some UI colors (yellow? it's relatively neutral)

Bootstrap (buttons can be made to include large amounts of text with a couple simple CSS overrides)
Sass
